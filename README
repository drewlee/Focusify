BACKGROUND

Focusify is a simple jQuery plugin for visually enhancing forms and form elements.
Problems arise when there is a requirement to provide visual cues to the user when he/she
is interacting with form fields. Since CSS works from a top down, left to right hierarchy,
there is no easy way to style elements that precede, or are the parents of a field that is in
focus. Focusify intends to resolve this problem by attaching a class to the fields's parent
element on focus, therefore providing a method of styling a focused element's label or parent wrapper.


USAGE

Simply initialize the plugin on the intended elements:

$('#login_form).find('inputs').focusify();

The plugin accepts two optional settings, a custom class name to apply to the field's parent element (default is 'infocus'),
and a jQuery selector string that specifies which parent element to apply the class name to (default is applied to direct parent
using .parent() method).

$('#login_form).find('inputs').focusify({
	classname: 'my-focus',	// default classname is 'infocus'
	parent: 'div.wrapper'	/* default uses .parent() to target the direct parent element, if specifying a custom selector,
				   .parents('selector') method is used instead, where 'selector' is the passed jQuery string */
});


METHODS

If you find the need to unbind focusify events and behaviors on your elements, use the 'destroy' method.

$('#login_form).find('inputs').focusify('destroy');
